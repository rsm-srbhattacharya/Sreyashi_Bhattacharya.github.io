# A Little Bit About Me  

I thrive on turning complex data into clear, actionable insights that drive real results.  

With a background in Economics and an MS in Business Analytics from UCSD, I bring 3+ years of experience in data science & analytics, working on:  

*Predictive modeling & Bayesian statistics* 
*A/B testing & experimentation*  
*Building interactive dashboards* 
*Data storytelling & business intelligence*

My passion lies in using data to solve real-world problems and drive business growth.
