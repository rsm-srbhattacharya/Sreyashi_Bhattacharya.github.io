#Question 1
#You are asked to calculate the brand shares for customers who purchased a smartphone 1 year ago and 2 years ago. The data is filtered by years_ago, and brand shares are computed for both time points.
#Once you've calculated the brand shares, report the delta_share (difference in brand share) between these two time points for the brand with the largest increase.



# brand/product shares
brand_shares1 <- cust_dat %>% filter(years_ago == 1) %>% count(brand) %>% mutate(n1=n, shr1 = n / sum(n)) %>% select(-n)
brand_shares2 <- cust_dat %>% filter(years_ago == 2) %>% count(brand) %>% mutate(n2=n, shr2 = n / sum(n)) %>% select(-n)

brand_shares1
brand_shares2

brand_shares <- merge(brand_shares1, brand_shares2, by="brand")
brand_shares %>% mutate(delta_share = shr1 - shr2)

#Question 2
#You have fit a multinomial logit model for cohort 2 with apple and samsung as predictors of smartphone choice. After fitting the model, you calculate the estimated market shares for each brand based on the model coefficients.
#After fitting the multinomial logit model and calculating the estimated market shares, you compare these shares to the actual market shares observed in the dataset.

#Question: How do the estimated market shares from the model compare to the actual market shares for the apple brand?
  
#A) The estimated market share for apple is higher than the actual market share.
#B) The estimated market share for apple is lower than the actual market share.
#C) The estimated market share for apple is nearly identical to the actual market share.***
#D) The estimated market share for apple is significantly different from the actual market share.


# brand-intercept-only model
out2 <- mlogit(choice ~ apple + samsung | 0, data=mdat2)
summary(out2)
# print the coefficients
coef(out2)

# print the brand market shares estimated from the model
coefs2 <- c(huawei = 0, coef(out2))
shares2 <- exp(coefs2) / sum(exp(coefs2)) # <-- formula from bottom of slide 14
#Question 3: What is Apple's market share? (Answer in percentage. upto 2 decimal places i.e, if your output is 0.8229 you should enter 82.29)
#Ans: 43.2
round(shares2, 3)

# print the actual brand market shares
brand_shares



#Again, for cohort 2, 
#You fit a multinomial logit (MNL) model , using product-specific intercepts (phone_id) and the price variable. 

#Question 4: What does the price coefficient suggest in this model?
  
#A) Price has a strong positive impact on product choice.
#B) Price has a strong negative impact on product choice.
#C) Price does not significantly affect product choice.***
#D) The effect of price is significant, but the direction is unclear


out <- mlogit(choice ~ phone_id + price | 0, data = mdat2)



summary(out)

#After fitting a multinomial logit (MNL) model for cohort 2, you calculate the brand hit rate using a custom function

#Question 5: The brand hit rate implies, the model correctly predicts the brand choice in _42.6___% of cases

brand_hit_rate(mdat2, out)


#Now you plot how histograms of choice probabilities for A1 change when phone discounts change and notice
#this homogeneous demand model shows no correspondence between customers' predicted
# choice shares and discount response. 

# You enrich this model to add heterogeneity
#and construct a model with both segment-specific and individual-specific heterogeneity
#choice ~ apple:segment + samsung:segment + 
#  price:segment + screen_size:segment + 
#  price:total_minutes:segment



#Question 6
#Which customer segment is the most sensitive to changes in price based on the provided coefficients?
  
#A) Segment 1 is the most price-sensitive because it has the most negative price coefficient.
#B) Segment 2 is the most price-sensitive because it has the smallest standard error.
#C) Segment 3 is the most price-sensitive because it has the highest z-value.
#D) Segment 1 is the least price-sensitive because it has the largest (most negative) price coefficient.
out_f <- mlogit(choice ~ apple:segment + samsung:segment + 
                 price:segment + screen_size:segment + 
                 price:total_minutes:segment | 0, data=mdat2)
summary(out_f)


#Question 7
#You are tasked with determining the optimal price for a new product. You ask them to consider using conjoint analysis instead of Van Westendorp's Price Sensitivity Meter. What would you say?

#A) Conjoint analysis can model the impact of different product features on price sensitivity, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of consumer preferences.

#B) Conjoint analysis directly asks consumers to specify the optimal price, providing clear and straightforward pricing recommendations.

#C) Conjoint analysis avoids the need for competitor analysis, focusing solely on the product's price.

#D) Conjoint analysis is quicker to implement than Van Westendorp's Price Sensitivity Meter, providing faster results.
