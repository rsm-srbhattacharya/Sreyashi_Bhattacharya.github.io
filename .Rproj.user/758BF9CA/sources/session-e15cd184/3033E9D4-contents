## Introduction

Probability distributions help us model real-world phenomena, from predicting extreme weather events to binary classification problems in machine learning. Two closely related but distinct distributions—the **Gumbel distribution** and the **Logistic distribution**—have interesting properties that make them useful in different scenarios.

## Overview  

This post will:  
- Explain the Gumbel and Logistic distributions  
- Discuss their real-world applications  
- Explore their mathematical connection  
- Introduce generalized forms of these distributions based on recent research  
- Visualize the distributions using Python  

## The Gumbel Distribution

The **Gumbel distribution** is an **Extreme Value Distribution** that models the probability of extreme values occurring in a dataset. It is particularly useful for predicting extreme events such as floods, heatwaves, and stock market crashes.

### Probability Density Function (PDF)

The Gumbel distribution is defined by the probability density function:

$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{\beta} e^{- \left( \frac{x - \mu}{\beta} + e^{- \frac{x - \mu}{\beta}} \right)}
$$

where:
- \( \mu \) (location parameter) determines where the peak of the distribution occurs.
- \( \beta \) (scale parameter) controls the spread of the distribution.

### Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)

The cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a Gumbel-distributed variable is:

$$
F(x) = e^{-e^{-(x-\mu)/\beta}}
$$

which describes the probability that \( X \) takes on a value less than or equal to \( x \).

```{python}
#| echo: false
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.stats import gumbel_r, logistic
```

```{python}

# Define parameters
mu, beta = 0, 1  # Gumbel distribution parameters

# Generate x values
x = np.linspace(-6, 6, 1000)

# Compute PDFs and CDFs
gumbel_pdf = gumbel_r.pdf(x, loc=mu, scale=beta)
gumbel_cdf = gumbel_r.cdf(x, loc=mu, scale=beta)

# Plot Gumbel PDF
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))
plt.plot(x, gumbel_pdf, label="Gumbel PDF", linestyle="dashed", color="blue")
plt.title("Gumbel Distribution - Probability Density Function")
plt.xlabel("x")
plt.ylabel("Density")
plt.legend()
plt.grid()
plt.show()

# Plot Gumbel CDF
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))
plt.plot(x, gumbel_cdf, label="Gumbel CDF", linestyle="dashed", color="blue")
plt.title("Gumbel Distribution - Cumulative Distribution Function")
plt.xlabel("x")
plt.ylabel("Cumulative Probability")
plt.legend()
plt.grid()
plt.show()
```

### Understanding \mu and \beta in the Gumbel Distribution

- \mu shifts the distribution left or right.
- \beta controls how spread out or concentrated the distribution is.
- The mode (most probable value) is exactly at \mu.
- The mean is given by:

  $$
  E[X] = \mu + \beta \gamma
  $$

  where \( \gamma \approx 0.5772 \) is the **Euler-Mascheroni constant**.

To estimate these parameters from data:
- \( \mu \) is estimated as \( \bar{x} - \beta \gamma \).
- \( \beta \) is estimated using the sample standard deviation:

  $$
  \beta \approx \frac{s}{\pi / \sqrt{6}}
  $$

### Real-Life Example

Imagine a climate scientist predicting the **maximum annual temperature** in a city over the next 50 years. Since the interest is in **extreme temperatures**, a distribution that focuses on the right tail of the data—like the Gumbel distribution—is needed.

## The Logistic Distribution

The **Logistic distribution** is similar to the normal distribution but has **heavier tails**, meaning that extreme values occur more frequently than they would in a normal distribution.

### Probability Density Function (PDF)

The logistic distribution is given by:

$$
f(x) = \frac{e^{- \frac{x - \mu}{s}}}{s \left(1 + e^{- \frac{x - \mu}{s}}\right)^2}
$$

where:
- \( \mu \) (location parameter) determines the center of the distribution.
- \( s \) (scale parameter) controls the spread.

### Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)

The cumulative distribution function (CDF) is:

$$
F(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(x - \mu)/s}}
$$

which resembles the **sigmoid function** commonly used in logistic regression.

```{python}
```


```{python}
#| layout-ncol: 2

mu,s = 0,1  # Logistic distribution parameters

logistic_pdf = logistic.pdf(x, loc=mu, scale=s)
logistic_cdf = logistic.cdf(x, loc=mu, scale=s)

# Plot Logistic PDF
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))
plt.plot(x, logistic_pdf, label="Logistic PDF", linestyle="solid", color="red")
plt.title("Logistic Distribution - Probability Density Function")
plt.xlabel("x")
plt.ylabel("Density")
plt.legend()
plt.grid()
plt.show()

# Plot Logistic CDF
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))
plt.plot(x, logistic_cdf, label="Logistic CDF", linestyle="solid", color="red")
plt.title("Logistic Distribution - Cumulative Distribution Function")
plt.xlabel("x")
plt.ylabel("Cumulative Probability")
plt.legend()
plt.grid()
plt.show()
```
### Understanding \( \mu \) and \( s \) in the Logistic Distribution

- \( \mu \) shifts the entire distribution left or right.
- \( s \) determines how spread out the distribution is.
- The mean and median are both equal to \( \mu \).
- The standard deviation is:

  $$
  \sigma = \frac{s\pi}{\sqrt{3}}
  $$

To estimate these parameters from data:
- \( \mu \) is simply the **sample mean** \( \bar{x} \).
- \( s \) is estimated using:

  $$
  s \approx \frac{s_X \sqrt{3}}{\pi}
  $$

### Real-Life Example

One key application of the logistic distribution is in **logistic regression**, which is used in medical research to model the probability of diseases, such as heart disease, based on risk factors.

## Mathematical Relationship: Difference of Two Gumbel Variables

### Definition

It turns out that the **difference of two independent Gumbel-distributed variables** follows a **Logistic distribution**:

\[
D = X_1 - X_2 \sim \text{Logistic}(\mu_1 - \mu_2, \beta)
\]

where:

$$
X_1 \sim \text{Gumbel}(\mu_1, \beta), \quad X_2 \sim \text{Gumbel}(\mu_2, \beta)
$$

### Deep dive 

1. Express the two Gumbel-distributed variables:

   $$
   X_1 = \mu_1 + \beta Z_1, \quad X_2 = \mu_2 + \beta Z_2
   $$

   where $Z_1$ and $Z_2$ are **i.i.d. standard Gumbel-distributed variables**.

2. Compute the difference:

   $$
   D = X_1 - X_2
   $$

   Expanding:

   $$
   D = (\mu_1 + \beta Z_1) - (\mu_2 + \beta Z_2)
   $$

   Simplifying:

   $$
   D = (\mu_1 - \mu_2) + \beta (Z_1 - Z_2)
   $$

3. Since **\Z_1 - Z_2 follows a standard Logistic(0,1) distribution**, we conclude:

   $$
   D \sim \text{Logistic}(\mu_1 - \mu_2, \beta)
   $$

## Python Simulation

Let's verify this numerically:

```{python}
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.stats import logistic

# Define parameters
mu1, mu2 = 10, 5  
beta = 2  
size = 100000  

# Generate two independent Gumbel-distributed variables
X1 = np.random.gumbel(mu1, beta, size)
X2 = np.random.gumbel(mu2, beta, size)

# Compute the difference
D = X1 - X2

# Fit a logistic distribution to the data
loc, scale = logistic.fit(D)

# Generate values for plotting
x = np.linspace(min(D), max(D), 1000)
pdf_logistic = logistic.pdf(x, loc=loc, scale=scale)

# Plot histogram and logistic fit
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.hist(D, bins=100, density=True, alpha=0.6, label="Empirical Difference Distribution")
plt.plot(x, pdf_logistic, 'r-', label=f"Fitted Logistic Distribution\n(μ={loc:.2f}, β={scale:.2f})")
plt.xlabel("Difference (X1 - X2)")
plt.ylabel("Density")
plt.title("Difference of Two Independent Gumbel-Distributed Variables")
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```


- The **Gumbel distribution** is used to model **extreme events** (e.g., highest temperature in a year).
- If we have **two such extreme events from different locations or sources**, their **difference** behaves like a **logistic distribution**.

Imagine two cities, City A and City B, where we record the hottest temperature each year. If we **subtract** the maximum temperatures of City A from City B, the result is a logistic distribution.

## Generalized Forms of Gumbel and Logistic Distributions

Recent research by **Aljarrah, Famoye, and Lee (2020)** introduced a **Generalized Logistic Distribution** that combines properties of both logistic and Gumbel distributions.

### Why is this Important?

1. The generalized logistic distribution can model **both symmetric and skewed data**.
2. It provides better fits for real-world skewed datasets compared to standard logistic or Gumbel distributions.
3. The research extends this into a **Generalized Logistic Regression Model**, which includes:
   - **Logistic-log-logistic regression**
   - **Weibull-extreme value regression**
   - **Log-Fréchet regression**
